			<h2>our story</h2>

			<p>We started from scratch now we are hereNowadays a man made gum base is used in chewing gum.

				Glycerine (gli-ser-een) and other vegetable oils keep the gum soft enough for chewing.
				Some gums are sweetened by sugar cane, beet sugar or corn syrup. Chewing these gums could cause tooth damage.
				Other sugar-free gums use artificial sweeteners which will not harm teeth.
				The most popular flavour for chewing gum is mint because it leaves a fresh taste in the mouth.
				Some gums use fruit or spice essences for flavour.
				Some gums use colourings to show the flavour of the gum.
				Look on the side of the packet to find out exactly which ingredients are in your favourite gum.Gum is meant to be chewed and not swallowed.
				The food that we eat is digested by our bodies and used to keep us healthy. Gum cannot be digested by our bodies.
				That doesn't mean that it will collect together inside to make a huge ball that will block everything and stop our bodies from working! Have you heard that story too?
				If you swallow gum it will be passed through the digestive system and come out through the body's waste disposal system in your poo. Swallowing chewing gum won't make you sick.
